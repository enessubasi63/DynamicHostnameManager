# DynamicHostnameManager
This project is designed to automatically change the hostname of a computer based on a predefined mapping stored in a text file. The program reads the current hostname of the machine, compares it with the mappings in the text file, and if a new hostname is found, it updates the machine's hostname accordingly.
